# Palia Clock

This is an experimental little tool for players of the game [Palia](https://palia.com/).
So far it is just a little tool to show the in-game time, 
so you can check wether your crops need more water or your favorite NPC is awake.

*This project is neither affiliated with nor officially supported by the creators of Palia.*

If you have not played the game yet, I can highly recommend trying!
